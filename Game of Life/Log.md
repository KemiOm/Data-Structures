# Collaboration
I discussed my solution with: Jordan Miller 
# Discussion
The first issue I ran into was when I was creating  my makefile:  I forgot how to write tendencies and the general formatting rules, so i had to refer back to the walkthrough and the notes 
My second issue came when I was creating my main.c file and I didn't understand how to copy my string init into an array 
- I had to refer to the C manual to remember how to use strcpy()
- Later when I tried to run the program and I was getting numbers larger than

* The total time you actually spent on the assignment, formatted as you see fit[^1], but must contain each "shift" during which you worked on the assignment and a brief description of the work completed in each shift, in a section with header "`# Actual time to complete assignment`"

* A brief discussion (~100 words) of the major conceptual and coding difficulties that you encountered in developing and debugging the program (and there will always be some), in a section with header "`# Discussion`", which must be the last section
