# Data Structures Repository

Welcome to the Data Structures repository! This repository contains a collection of projects and assignments completed for the class Data Structures and Programming Techniques. Throughout these projects, we explore and implement various data structures and algorithms using C/C++.

## Projects and Assignments

### 1. Project 1: Arrays
In this project, we delve into the fundamentals of arrays. We implement basic array operations such as insertion, deletion, and searching. Additionally, we explore advanced array manipulation techniques to gain a deeper understanding of array data structures.

### 2. Project 2: Linked Lists
Project 2 focuses on linked lists, a fundamental data structure in computer science. We implement both singly linked lists and doubly linked lists, along with operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal. Furthermore, we explore advanced concepts like circular linked lists and linked list manipulation algorithms.

### 3. Project 3: Trees
Trees are hierarchical data structures widely used in computer science. In Project 3, we study various types of trees, including binary trees, binary search trees (BSTs), AVL trees, and Red-Black trees. We implement tree traversal algorithms, insertion, deletion, and balancing operations to understand the intricacies of tree-based data structures.

### 4. Project 4: Maps and Hash Tables
Maps and hash tables are essential data structures for efficient key-value storage and retrieval. In Project 4, we delve into the implementation of hash tables using different collision resolution techniques such as chaining and open addressing. We also explore map implementations using trees and hash tables to understand their trade-offs in terms of performance and memory usage.

### 5. Final Project: Comprehensive Data Structures Implementation
The final project is a culmination of our learning throughout the course. We design and implement a comprehensive set of data structures, including arrays, linked lists, trees, maps, and hash tables. This project challenges us to apply our knowledge to solve real-world problems efficiently and effectively.
