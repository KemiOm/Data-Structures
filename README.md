# CPSC 223 SPRING 2023 PSET 1: Game of Life

## Project Title
One-Dimensional Conway's Game of Life Simulation

## Overview
This project involves designing and implementing a C program to simulate a one-dimensional version of Conway's Game of Life. The program will use a statically-allocated array to represent a grid of cells that are either alive or dead, evolving over time according to specified rules.

## Motivation
The motivation behind this project is to build an understanding of statically-allocated memory in C programming. By restricting the use of dynamic memory allocation, the project reinforces the concepts of memory management and array manipulation in C.


## Code Style
- Code Style: js-standard-style

## Screenshots


## Tech/Framework Used
- Built with: C, Makefile

## Features
- Simulates a one-dimensional version of Conway's Game of Life
- Statically-allocated memory for grid representation
- Command-line interface for initial state and number of generations
- Step-by-step simulation output

## Code Example
bool isAlive(int field[], size_t i, size_t size);
  ```
    The `isAlive` function takes as arguments an array of `int`s called `field`, an index `i`, and the size of the array (`size`).
    It returns `true` if the cell at position `i` is alive, otherwise returns `false`.
    Note that unlike in many languages, `bool`, `true` and `false` are not keywords in C, so you must `#include <stdbool.h>` to use them.
* ```C
  bool shouldDie(int field[], size_t i, size_t size);
  ```
    The `shouldDie` function takes as arguments an array of `int`s called `field`, an index `i`, and the size of the array (`size`).
    It returns `true` if cell `i` has two live neighbors; otherwise it returns `false`.
    > **Hint**: Checking for neighbors that donâ€™t exist (*e.g.*, things at index `-1` or at an index equal to `size`) will cause an error.
    > Check your indexes before using them! 

> **Note**: The starter code for this assignment includes a ready-to-go `life.h` header file.
> You may add to that file, but **do not change anything that is already there**.
