# Collaboration
I discussed my solution with: Jordan Miller 
# Discussion
My first issue was with gmap_put and making sure I was returning the right amount. My second issue came when i didn't realize 
that i was going to have create an embiggen function in my gmap.c and contract. I didn't watch the walk-mes and I was failing my unit 12.
Then I started on my blotto.c file and I originally was rewrite my whole entry.c file but when I got to compiling it was barely doing things correclty. My code felt two convulted so I switched how I was handling everything and I decided to use the provided entry read and then handle the edge cases after. I then ran into a issue where I was allocating points incorrectly I was assigning the distribution to the final score and not the value of the battlefield. I ran into a major issue when my Test./test wasn't marking my code as correct but the autograder was, the other ULA couldn't figure it out, but it worked on the autograder, so I just have to reupload whenever I want to test my whole code.
