# Collaboration
I discussed my solution with: Jordan Miller and Fatima Aw
# Discussion
I started of strong with do a majority of pirates and pirates_list on my first day. I then ended up wasting a majority of my time day 2 and 3 trying to figure out where my code was seg faulting. My most difficult issue was my one segfault error I figure out that their was a problem in my skills_list.c where I wasn't free my lst after destroying everything else stored in my node. I also had a major issue in my vessel_sort I ended up figuring out that the issue wasn't in my vessel_sort specifically but their was a problem with how I was indexing in my partition. i was failing to do my last comparison on my list. Another small issue was printing out my lists. I had to remember the correct format and making sure that in my skills_list pirnt I wasn't repeating the word Skills: I don't know why I was stumped. i think I also had difficult comnbining my function I mention list destroy inside of my pirate destroy I didn't realize till later some of the issue it could cause if I got my parameters wrong.
